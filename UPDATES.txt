    - I added a new scanning class that will do everything we need it to do in regards to checking if user has inputed quit or not. I've just managed to get the "int" version working.
        - There are two methods, CustomScan.scanInt() which scans nextLine and returns a int and CustomScan.scanIntBetween(int low, int high) which only allows inputs between the low and high
        - Both methds checks to see if the user has ented quit or not. 
    - Added some TODO's at the top of the main class just so we dont end up working on the same thing.
